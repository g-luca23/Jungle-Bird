# Jungle Bird

A Software Engineering project - Università di Bologna.

## Overview
**Jungle Bird** is a captivating mobile puzzle game designed to challenge players with engaging color-sorting mechanics. The game’s primary goal is to sort birds of different colors onto matching branches, creating order out of chaos. Once birds are grouped by color, they take flight, allowing the player to clear the board. As players advance, the complexity of the levels increases, introducing new challenges and enhancing the puzzle-solving experience.

The game is designed for mobile platforms (iOS and Android), offering users a smooth and intuitive interface to engage with the puzzles. With over 1000 dynamically generated levels, Jungle Bird can keep players engaged for hours. Players are encouraged to use strategic thinking to solve puzzles efficiently, while the point system rewards both speed and accuracy.

In addition to its core puzzle mechanics, Jungle Bird includes an optimal solution finder to help players overcome difficult levels.
