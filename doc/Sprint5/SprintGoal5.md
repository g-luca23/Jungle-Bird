# Sprint Goal 5

Sprint 5 is necessary to finish what we couldn't in Sprint 4. There are no new User Stories, just technical debt from the previous sprint. This sprint is also necessary for the team to properly implement testing on the most recent additions, like the optimal-move suggestion, which is logic-heavy and requires a lot of attentions.
