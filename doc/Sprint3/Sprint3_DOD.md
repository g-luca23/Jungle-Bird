# Sprint 3

## Definition of Ready
1. All team members understand the sprint goals and tasks associated with the User Stories.  
2. User stories are fully refined and estimated, with acceptance criteria clearly defined.  
3. Design mockups for the level counter and visual/audio elements for special birds are finalized and approved.  
4. Gameplay mechanics for handling special birds (e.g., caged bird, sleeping bird, bomb countdown) are documented with clear behavioral rules.  
5. The foundational gameplay loop from previous sprints is stable and ready for new mechanics.  
6. Design assets for special birds and their associated UI elements (e.g., counters, key graphics) are prepared and available.  
7. Task assignments and subtasks are defined and documented in the project management tool.

## Definition of Done
1. A functional level counter is implemented, visible in the main menu, gameplay view, and level completion screen.  
2. Levels can include special birds based on the defined frequency (e.g., 1 malus every 8 games, 2 malus every 15 games).  
3. Special bird behaviors are implemented:
   - Caged bird requires a key bird to unlock.  
   - Sleeping bird requires an alarm clock bird to wake up.  
   - Bomb bird has a visible countdown and causes the level to fail if not cleared in time.  
4. Special bird interactions are tested and work seamlessly within the existing gameplay mechanics.  
5. Visual and audio feedback for interacting with special birds are implemented and functional.  
6. Code for the level counter and special bird mechanics is committed, peer-reviewed, and merged into the main branch.  
7. Documentation in the project wiki is updated, including:
   - Rules and behaviors of special birds.  
   - Implementation details for the level counter.
